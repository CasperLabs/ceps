   An honest node can cite an equivocator
   without knowing they are an equivocator.

   In this case we store the equivocator's
   vote even though it is spam.

  rnote over Equivocator, Node1 #white
    An equivocator can't send spam to the
    same node twice, however, without being
    detected.

    After the second spam message the
    equivocator is detected and the spam
    is discarded.
